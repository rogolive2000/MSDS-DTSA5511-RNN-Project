Twitter has undoubtedly become a powerful tool for communication in times of emergency. With the increasing ubiquity of smartphones, individuals are now able to report events as they happen in real-time. As a result, more organizations are turning to Twitter as a source of information during disasters, including relief organizations and news agencies.

However, the challenge lies in identifying which tweets are truly indicative of an emergency, as not all tweets that contain certain keywords or phrases necessarily correspond to a real disaster. This is where machine learning comes in.

Through the development of a machine learning model, we can predict which tweets are relevant to a disaster and which ones aren't. By leveraging a dataset of 10,000 hand-classified tweets, we can train the model to identify patterns and trends that are indicative of real disasters.

The model will utilize a variety of natural language processing techniques, to determine whether a tweet is likely to be about an emergency. Additionally, the model will be trained on a range of disaster scenarios, including natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, as well as man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks and industrial accidents.

This kind of model could potentially be used to programatically monitor Twitter in real-time, providing a powerful tool for disaster relief organizations and news agencies. The model could be integrated into existing systems to provide alerts and notifications in the event of an emergency, enabling faster response times and potentially saving lives.

To evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithm for identifying tweets about disasters, multiple evaluation metrics will be used. The primary evaluation metric will be the F1 score, which is a weighted average of precision and recall. In addition to the F1 score, accuracy, AUC-ROC and MSE will also be calculated to evaluate the model's predictive power. By using multiple evaluation metrics, we can obtain a more nuanced understanding of the algorithm's performance, identifying any strengths and weaknesses in its classification abilities.

Note: the result of the final model will be submitted to Kaggle to participate in the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition. See https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview
